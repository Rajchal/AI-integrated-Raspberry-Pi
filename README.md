# AI-integrated-Raspberry-Pi
This software connects Raspberry Pi with AI through a local large language model, enabling students and teachers in rural areas to access intelligent educational support without internet. It offers personalised, fast, and offline learning assistance, making advanced technology accessible and inclusive for all.

This software serves as a bridge between the Raspberry Pi and artificial intelligence by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It is specifically designed to support students and teachers in rural and underserved regions, where access to high-speed internet and modern technological infrastructure is often limited or unreliable.

Our solution harnesses the power of a locally hosted large language model—comparable in functionality to systems like ChatGPT—integrated directly into the Raspberry Pi 5. This setup enables advanced AI functionalities without the need for a constant internet connection, allowing users to access intelligent educational support completely offline.

The core objective of this project is to democratise access to cutting-edge educational tools powered by artificial intelligence. By embedding the LLM within the Raspberry Pi hardware, we ensure that users in remote areas can benefit from fast, responsive, and context-aware learning assistance. The model is capable of understanding and generating human-like responses to a wide range of academic queries, spanning science, mathematics, language, and general knowledge, all tailored to the user's learning level.

This initiative not only empowers students with personalised learning experiences but also supports teachers by providing them with an intelligent assistant to aid lesson planning, generate explanations, and answer subject-related questions. The model’s functionality is enhanced by a local memory system, enabling it to remember user preferences and intellectual levels, thereby refining interactions over time.

By removing dependence on external servers or internet connectivity, this project embodies a sustainable and inclusive approach to digital education. It reflects our commitment to closing the educational divide by ensuring that the benefits of artificial intelligence are accessible to all, regardless of geographical or economic barriers.

Ultimately, this integration of AI and low-cost computing represents a significant step forward in providing equitable, high-quality educational resources to communities that have historically been left behind in the digital revolution.
